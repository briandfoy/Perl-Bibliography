Writing Perl Modules for CPAN offers Perl developers a comprehensive
guide to using and contributing to the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network (CPAN). Starting with a general overview of CPAN's history,
network topology, and navigational mechanisms, the book quickly brings
you up-to-speed regarding how to search out and install available
modules. However, in the true open source spirit, author and
experienced Perl developer Sam Tregar teaches you how to not only use,
but also contribute to CPAN via an in-depth discussion of module
creation, submission, and maintenance.

Beginning with a survey of basic design principles, Tregar takes care
to discuss all issues relevant to developers wishing to create great
Perl modules, including choosing a proper name, properly using Perl's
POD (plain old documentation) feature, concepts surrounding functional
and object-oriented API development, and much more. Tregar then
proceeds with a complete dissertation of how modules should conform to
CPAN module specifications, covering required distribution files and
coding considerations, in addition to offering advice regarding proper
module testing. After demonstrating how to create a module and prepare
it for release, Tregar guides you through the CPAN module submission
process and discusses module maintenance once the module has been
contributed to the CPAN service.

Writing Perl Modules for CPAN is an indispensable guide for anyone
wishing to make the most of the CPAN service.
