Adopted as the undisputed Perl bible soon after the first edition
appeared in 1991, Programming Perl is still the go-to guide for this
highly practical language. Perl began life as a super-fueled text
processing utility, but quickly evolved into a general purpose
programming language that’s helped hundreds of thousands of
programmers, system administrators, and enthusiasts, like you, get
your job done.

In this much-anticipated update to "the Camel," three renowned Perl
authors cover the language up to its current version, Perl 5.14, with
a preview of features in the upcoming 5.16. In a world where Unicode
is increasingly essential for text processing, Perl offers the best
and least painful support of any major language, smoothly integrating
Unicode everywhere—including in Perl’s most popular feature: regular
expressions.

Important features covered by this update include:

New keywords and syntax
I/O layers and encodings
New backslash escapes
Unicode 6.0
Unicode grapheme clusters and properties
Named captures in regexes
Recursive and grammatical patterns
Expanded coverage of CPAN
Current best practices
