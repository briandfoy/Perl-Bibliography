With more than a million dedicated programmers, Perl has proven to be
the best computing language for the latest trends in computing and
business. While other languages have stagnated, Perl remains fresh,
thanks to its community-based development model, which encourages the
sharing of information among users. This tradition of
knowledge-sharing allows developers to find answers to almost any Perl
question they can dream up.

And you can find many of those answers right here in Perl Hacks. Like
all books in O'Reilly's Hacks Series, Perl Hacks appeals to a variety
of programmers, whether you're an experienced developer or a dabbler
who simply enjoys exploring technology. Each hack is a short
lesson--some are practical exercises that teach you essential skills,
while others merely illustrate some of the fun things that Perl can
do. Most hacks have two parts: a direct answer to the immediate
problem you need to solve right now and a deeper, subtler technique
that you can adapt to other situations. Learn how to add CPAN
shortcuts to the Firefox web browser, read files backwards, write
graphical games in Perl, and much more.
