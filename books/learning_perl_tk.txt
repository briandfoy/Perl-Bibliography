Learning Perl/Tk is a tutorial for Perl/Tk, the extension to Perl for
creating graphical user interfaces. With Tk, Perl programs can be
window-based rather than command-line based, with buttons, entry
fields, listboxes, menus, and scrollbars. Originally developed for the
Tcl language, the Perl port of the Tk toolkit liberates Perl
programmers from the world of command-line options, STDIN, and STDOUT,
allowing them to build graphical, event-driven applications for both
Windows and UNIX.

This book is aimed at Perl novices and experts alike. It explains the
reasoning behind event-driven applications and drills in guidelines on
how to best design graphical applications. It teaches how to implement
and configure each of the Perl/Tk graphical elements step-by-step.
Special attention is given to the geometry managers, which are needed
to position each button, menu, label and listbox in the window frame.

Although this book does not teach basic Perl, anyone who has written
even the simplest Perl program should be able to learn Tk from this
book. The writing is breezy and informal, and gets right to the point
of what you need to know and why. The book is rife with illustrations
that demonstrate how each element is drawn and how its configuration
options affect its presentation.

Learning Perl/Tk is for every Perl programmer who would like to
implement simple, easy-to-use graphical interfaces.
