This is the third in O'Reilly's series of landmark Perl tutorials,
which started with Learning Perl, the bestselling introduction that
taught you the basics of Perl syntax, and Intermediate Perl, which
taught you how to create re-usable Perl software. Mastering Perl pulls
everything together to show you how to bend Perl to your will. It
convey's Perl's special models and programming idioms.

This book isn't a collection of clever tricks, but a way of thinking
about Perl programming so you can integrate the real-life problems of
debugging, maintenance, configuration, and other tasks you encounter
as a working programmer.

The book explains how to:

Use advanced regular expressions, including global matches, lookarounds, readable regexes, and regex debugging
Avoid common programing problems with secure programming techniques
Profile and benchmark Perl to find out where to focus your improvements
Wrangle Perl code to make it more presentable and readable
See how Perl keeps track of package variables and how you can use that for some powerful tricks
Define subroutines on the fly and turn the tables on normal procedural programming.
Modify and jury rig modules to fix code without editing the original source
Let your users configure your programs without touching the code
Learn how you can detect errors Perl doesn't report, and how to tell users about them
Let your Perl program talk back to you by using Log4perl
Store data for later use in another program, a later run of the same program, or to send them over a network
Write programs as modules to get the benefit of Perl's distribution and testing tools
Appendices include "brian's Guide to Solving Any Perl Problem" to improve your troubleshooting skills, as well as suggested reading to continue your Perl education. Mastering Perl starts you on your path to becoming the person with the answers, and, failing that, the person who knows how to find the answers or discover the problem.
