An increasing number of tasks in application programming and web
design requires creating and manipulating graphics. Perl is a powerful
and flexible language that is not commonly associated with graphics
programming. The speed of developing in Perl plus the large number of
freely available Perl graphics modules, make it an excellent option
for the rapid development of graphics applications.

Graphics Programming with Perl is a guide to the graphics and imaging
modules and tools available to the Perl programmer. It covers subjects
ranging from drawing your own pictures and dynamic graphics for web
pages to rendering three-dimensional scenes and manipulating
individual image pixels. The text is liberally illustrated with
example code and programs that show how to achieve common, and
sometimes not so common, graphics programming tasks. For the even less
common tasks, the book shows you how to write your own modules.

What's inside:

How to create charts and graphs
Serving graphics content to the WWW with CGI
How to modularize your graphics code, and re-use it
Code to manipulate image pixels (and how to do it fast)
How to work with text in graphics
A complete reference for Image::Magick
Examples you can use and build on:
Adding watermarks to your images
Creating thumbnails
Dynamic web pages with charts
Building your own convolution filters
A web photo album
3D animation with OpenGL and Renderman
