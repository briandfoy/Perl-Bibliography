Perl is a complex language that can be difficult to master. Perl
advocates boast that "There's More Than One Way To Do It", but do you
really want to learn several ways of saying the same thing to a
computer?

To make Perl more accessible, Dr. Tim Maher has over the years
designed and taught an essential subset of the language that is
smaller, yet practical and powerful. With this engaging book you can
now benefit from "Minimal Perl", even if all you know about Unix is
grep.

You will learn how to write simple Perl commands (many just
one-liners) that go far beyond the limitations of Unix utilities, and
those of Linux, MacOS/X, etc. And youï¿½ll acquire the more advanced
Perl skills used in scripts by capitalizing on your knowledge of
related Shell resources. Sprinkled throughout are many Unix-specific
Perl tips.

This book is especially suitable for system administrators,
webmasters, and software developers.

WHAT'S INSIDE:
A simpler, yet still powerful Perl
Development of concise commands and flexible scripts
How to package custom software in reusable modules
How to exploit CPAN modules to avoid reinventing the wheel
Language features in tabular summaries
100+ reusable programs for: system administration, web development (HTML, CGI, Forms), networking, databases, finance, text analysis, and more
