Perl, one of the worldâ€™s most diffuse programming languages, was born
out of the need to resolve the creator's dissatisfaction with what
were at the time standard data-parsing solutions. Indeed, since the
1.0 release in 1987, Perl has been heralded for its powerful parsing
capabilities features that are further enhanced through the thousands
of Perl extensions made available through CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network).

Pro Perl Parsing begins with several chapters devoted to key parsing
principles, discussing topics pertinent to regular expressions,
parsing grammars, and parsing techniques. This material sets the stage
for later chapters, which introduce numerous and powerful CPAN parsing
modules, and provide an ample supply of example applications.
