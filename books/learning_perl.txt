If you're just getting started with Perl, this is the book you
want—whether you're a programmer, system administrator, or web hacker.
Nicknamed "the Llama" by two generations of users, this bestseller
closely follows the popular introductory Perl course taught by the
authors since 1991. This 6th edition covers recent changes to the
language up to version 5.14.

Perl is suitable for almost any task on almost any platform, from
short fixes to complete web applications. Learning Perl teaches you
the basics and shows you how to write programs up to 128 lines
long—roughly the size of 90% of the Perl programs in use today. Each
chapter includes exercises to help you practice what you've just
learned. Other books may teach you to program in Perl, but this book
will turn you into a Perl programmer.

Topics include:

Perl data and variable types
Subroutines
File operations
Regular expressions
String manipulation (including Unicode)
Lists and sorting
Process management
Smart matching
Use of third party modules
