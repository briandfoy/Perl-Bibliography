Many programmers would love to use Perl for projects that involve
heavy lifting, but miss the many traditional algorithms that textbooks
teach for other languages. Computer scientists have identified many
techniques that a wide range of programs need, such as:

Fuzzy pattern matching for text (identify misspellings!)
Finding correlations in data
Game-playing algorithms
Predicting phenomena such as Web traffic
Polynomial and spline fitting

Using algorithms explained in this book, you too can carry out
traditional programming tasks in a high-powered, efficient,
easy-to-maintain manner with Perl.

This book assumes a basic understanding of Perl syntax and functions,
but not necessarily any background in computer science. The authors
explain in a readable fashion the reasons for using various classic
programming techniques, the kind of applications that use them, and --
most important -- how to code these algorithms in Perl.

If you are an amateur programmer, this book will fill you in on the
essential algorithms you need to solve problems like an expert. If you
have already learned algorithms in other languages, you will be
surprised at how much different (and often easier) it is to implement
them in Perl. And yes, the book even has the obligatory fractal
display program.

There have been dozens of books on programming algorithms, some of
them excellent, but never before has there been one that uses Perl.
