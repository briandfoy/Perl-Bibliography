In this introduction to computational molecular biology, Rex Dwyer
explains many basic computational problems and gives concise, working
programs to solve them in the Perl programming language. With minimal
prerequisites, he covers the biological background for each problem,
develops a model for the solution, and then introduces the Perl
concepts needed to implement the solution. The chapters discuss
pairwise and multiple sequence alignment, fast database searches for
homologous sequences, protein motif identification, genome
rearrangement, physical mapping, phylogeny reconstruction, satellite
identification, sequence assembly, gene finding, and RNA secondary
structure. Concrete examples and a step-by-step approach enable
readers to grasp the computational and statistical methods.
