Object Oriented Perl is designed to provide anyone who is familiar
with the basics of regular Perl programming with a complete
introduction to the object-oriented features of Perl. The book moves
from the very simplest applications through advanced applications such
as generic programming, multiple dispatch, and object-oriented
persistence. Thus, it offers a much-needed resource for persons new to
Perl, as well as new and valuable insights and techniques for even the
most accomplished Perl programmers.

Beyond explaining the syntax and semantics of Perl's inbuilt
object-oriented features, Object Oriented Perl explains how to apply
those features in a wide range of programming techniques. Each
technique is illustrated with complete examples.

Object Oriented Perl also discusses the latest relevant Perl modules,
which are freely available and can greatly simplify object-oriented
development in Perl. In particular, it examines the new standard
"fields" module and the associated pseudo-hash construct.

No other book covers the topic of object-oriented software development
in Perl in such breadth, to such depth, or in such a readable manner.
Complete source code for Object Oriented Perl is available online to
owners of the book.
