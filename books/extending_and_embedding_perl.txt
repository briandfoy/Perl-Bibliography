Extending and Embedding Perl explains how to expand the functionality
and usefulness of the Perl programming language and how to use Perl
from C programs. It begins simply but also covers complex issues using
real code examples from the Perl source. The book discusses how to
write interfaces to C libraries (as well as C++ and Fortran
libraries). It shows you how to implement Perl callbacks for C
libraries, how to pass Perl hashes and arrays between Perl and C, and
how to use the Perl Data Language infrastructure to improve the speed
of array operations.

Additionally, the book peers under the hood to see how the Perl
programming language really works by looking at the interpreter. The
make-up of Perl variables is discussed along with details on how a
Perl program is parsed and converted to executable code.
