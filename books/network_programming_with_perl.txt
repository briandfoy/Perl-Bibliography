Network Programming with Perl is a comprehensive, example-rich guide
to creating network-based applications using the Perl programming
language. Among its many capabilities, modern Perl provides a
straightforward and powerful interface to TCP/IP, and this book shows
how to leverage these capabilities to create robust, maintainable, and
efficient custom client/server applications. The book quickly moves
beyond the basics to focus on high-level, application programming
concepts, tools, and techniques. Students will find a review of basic
networking concepts and Perl fundamentals, including Perl's I/O
functions, process model, and object-oriented extensions. In addition,
the book examines a collection of the best third-party modules in the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, including existing network
protocols for e-mail, news, and the Web.
