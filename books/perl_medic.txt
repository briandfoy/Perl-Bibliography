This book is about taking over Perl code, whether written by someone
else or by yourself at an earlier time. Developers regularly estimate
that they spend 60 to 80 percent of their time working with existing
code. Many problems of code inheritance are common to all languages,
but the nature of the language makes Perl especially tricky. The
reason why is that Perl is similar to English - bursting with
irregular verbs, consistent only when it's convenient, borrowing terms
from other languages, and providing many ways to say the same thing.
In fact, Perl developers have a motto with the abbreviation TMTOWTDI:
There's More Than One Way To Do It. While this flexibility is one of
the language's strengths, it also makes it extremely difficult when
you are faced with an existing piece of code. There are millions of
lines of Perl code being used all over the Web; much of it was built
on an ad hoc basis, the creators never imagining that the code would
still be in use months or years later. This book will be the resource
all Perl programmers need to understand someone else's code, even when
it's bad; repair it; convert it to a better style; upgrade it to the
latest version of Perl; maintain it; and find and fix its bugs.
