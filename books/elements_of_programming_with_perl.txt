As the complexity of web sites grows, more and more webmasters need to
acquire programming skills. Naturally, such persons are inclined to
learn Perl, the "language of the web." However, there has been no book
to treat Perl as the first programming language; every Perl book
assumes that the reader can program already.

Until now.

Elements of Programming with Perl is a general introduction to
programming, using Perl as the implementation language. It starts at
the beginning, teaching programming style, structure, and design. It
covers all the fundamental elements of Perl (e.g., pattern matching
and text processing) and proceeds to advanced concepts, including
modular programming, abstract data structures, and object oriented
programming.

Elements of Programming with Perl contains numerous examples and
diagrams that illustrate concepts, algorithms and techniques. Complete
example programs show the new programmer how to tie concepts together
to solve real-world problems.

Elements of Programming with Perl is designed for the new programmer
who needs to know Perl, and for the regular Perl user who would like
to improve his or her programming skills.
