Over the years, Perl has grown from an elegant scripting tool into a
mature and full-featured language for application development,
boasting object-oriented programming, a flexible threading model,
built-in support for Unicode, and a thriving community. Available on
almost every platform, and offering a comprehensive library of
modules, there is no task too big or small for Perl to tackle.

Pro Perl helps you master the key features and complexities of this
powerful language. Aimed at intermediate and advanced developers
alike, the material assumes some general knowledge of programming
concepts but not necessarily prior Perl experience. However, given the
expansive coverage of core language topics, Pro Perl also serves as a
valuable guide to seasoned Perl programmers seeking to push their
proficiency to the next level.

Using a depth-first approach to aid learning of advanced concepts,
youâ€™re provided with detailed examinations of many key topics,
including regular expressions, networking, modules and packages,
object-oriented development, and much more. Pro Perl seeks to provide
developers with not only the answers to their programming questions,
but also advanced ideas and related concepts that expand the
developer's understanding of Perl as a language.

This edition of Pro Perl offers updated and expanded content, and
improved organization by combining material from previous editions of
Professional Perl Programming and Professional Perl Development.
