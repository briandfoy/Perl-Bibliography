Perl/Tk is the marriage of the Tk graphical toolkit with Perl, the
powerful programming language used primarily for system
administration, web programming, and database manipulation. With
Perl/Tk, you can build Perl programs with an attractive, intuitive GUI
interface with all the power of Perl behind it.

Mastering Perl/Tk is the "bible" of Perl/Tk: It's not only a great
book for getting started, but the best reference for learning the
techniques of experienced Perl/Tk programmers. The first half of the
book contains the basics on how to use Perl/Tk, and then branches out
into advanced applications with a series of extensive program
examples. The result is a book accessible for novices, and invaluable
for experienced programmers ready to learn the next step in the
elegant and effective use of Perl/Tk. The book includes:

An introduction to each of the basic Perl/Tk widgets and geometry managers
A dissection of the MainLoop, including how to use callbacks and bindings effectively
Coverage of the Tix widgets, an extended set of widgets that are a part of the standard Perl/Tk distribution
Working with images in Perl/Tk, including bitmaps, pixmaps, photos, and how to compose a compound image type
How to create custom mega-widgets in Perl/Tk, both composite and derived
Handling interprocess communication with Perl/Tk, both with standard Unix utilities (pipes and sockets) and with the send command designed for direct communication between Tk applications
Developing your own Tk widget in the C language
Examples of web applications written with Perl/Tk and the LWP library

The book also includes appendices on installing Perl/Tk, a complete
quick-reference for each standard widget, and listings of all the
extended examples in the book.

Nancy Walsh is the author of Learning Perl/Tk, and Steve Lidie wrote
the Perl/Tk Pocket Reference as well as a series of Perl/Tk articles
in The Perl Journal. Together, they have written Mastering Perl/Tk to
be the definitive guide to Perl/Tk.
