One of the greatest strengths of the Perl programming language is its
ability to manipulate large amounts of data. Database programming is
therefore a natural fit for Perl, not only for business applications
but also for CGI-based web and intranet applications.

The primary interface for database programming in Perl is DBI. DBI is
a database-independent package that provides a consistent set of
routines regardless of what database product you use--Oracle, Sybase,
Ingres, Informix, you name it. The design of DBI is to separate the
actual database drivers (DBDs) from the programmer's API, so any DBI
program can work with any database, or even with multiple databases by
different vendors simultaneously.

Programming the Perl DBI is coauthored by Alligator Descartes, one of
the most active members of the DBI community, and by Tim Bunce, the
inventor of DBI. For the uninitiated, the book explains the
architecture of DBI and shows you how to write DBI-based programs. For
the experienced DBI dabbler, this book reveals DBI's nuances and the
peculiarities of each individual DBD.

The book includes:

An introduction to DBI and its design
How to construct queries and bind parameters
Working with database, driver, and statement handles
Debugging techniques
Coverage of each existing DBD
A complete reference to DBI

This is the definitive book for database programming in Perl.
