If you have a Perl programming question, you'll find the answer
quickly in this handy, easy-to-use quick reference. The Perl Pocket
Reference condenses and organizes stacks of documentation down to the
most essential facts, so you can find what you need in a heartbeat.

Updated for Perl 5.14, the 5th edition provides a summary of Perl
syntax rules and a complete list of operators, built-in functions, and
other features. It's the perfect companion to O'Reilly's authoritative
and in-depth Perl programming books, including Learning Perl,
Programming Perl, and the Perl Cookbook.
