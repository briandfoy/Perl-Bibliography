Your desktop dictionary may not include it, but 'munging' is a common
term in the programmer's world. Many computing tasks require taking
data from one computer system, manipulating it in some way, and
passing it to another. Munging can mean manipulating raw data to
achieve a final form. It can mean parsing or filtering data, or the
many steps required for data recognition. Or it can be something as
simple as converting hours worked plus pay rates into a salary cheque.

This book shows you how to process data productively with Perl. It
discusses general munging techniques and how to think about data
munging problems. You will learn how to decouple the various stages of
munging programs, how to design data structures, how to emulate the
Unix filter model, etc. If you need to work with complex data formats
it will teach you how to do that and also how to build your own tools
to process these formats. The book includes detailed techniques for
processing HTML and XML. And, it shows you how to build your own
parsers to process data of arbitrary complexity.

If you are a programmer who munges data, this book will save you time.
It will teach you systematic and powerful techniques using Perl. If
you are not a Perl programmer, this book may just convince you to add
Perl to your repertoire.

What's inside:

Using CPAN modules like Number::Format, Date::Manip, Text::CSV_XS
Making your code concise using Perl's special variables (like $/, $? and $_)
Building data parsers using Parse::RecDescent
