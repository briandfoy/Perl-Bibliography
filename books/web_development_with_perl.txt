Open source tools provide a powerful and flexible environment for web
development and maintenance. If your site has complex business rules
or server logic, then you need more than just an interface builder.
You need a strong application language with effective tools ready at
hand. Perl's strengths make it a natural choice.

Did you know you can easily build a site with features like message
forums, chat, session management, custom preferences and other
features your users will love? This book shows you how. But it is more
than a programming book. It covers a wide spectrum of practical issues
and how to handle them, such as when to use a database, what
information needs to be secure (and how to secure it), and how to keep
traffic from crippling your site. It will teach you the empowering use
of ready-made modules so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. And it
will even teach you how to successfully advocate the use of Open
Source tools in your company.

What's Inside:

CGI and mod_perl programming
mod_ssl, mod_rewrite and other Apache modules
Using DBI with databases
HTML::Mason and Template Toolkit for embedded scripting
User login and session management
Performance and system monitoring tools
Growth planning and disaster recovery
