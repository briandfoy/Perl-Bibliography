Adding a cache layer to the popular LAMP stack is becoming the common
solution to significantly reduce the load on back-end databases, and
also allows for better web application performance. This new caching
component is represented by another "m" in LAMMP, which stands for
memcachedâ€”a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system
that provides caching for web applications. The author walks you
through the process of using Perl to develop web applications both in
terms of the front-end display logic as well as the back-end data
retrieval from MySQL and memcached. You also see how to configure the
Apache web server to run these mod_perl applications.

You'll discover that MySQL and memcached are where the data is stored,
and Apache is the server that hosts this functionality. You'll also
examine each system while you learn how to install, set up, and
administer it.

The book shows you how to put each of these systems together so you
can start building successful applications. Helpful examples put in
practice the information covered throughout the book and a
problem-solving chapter offers real-world problems and the process of
how you might go about finding a solution to them.
