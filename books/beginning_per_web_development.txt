Beginning Perl Web Development: From Novice to Professional introduces
you to the world of Perl Internet application development. This book
tackles all areas crucial to developing your first web applications
and includes a powerful combination of real-world examples coupled
with advice. Topics range from serving and consuming RSS feeds, to
monitoring Internet servers, to interfacing with e-mail. Youâ€™ll learn
how to use Perl with ancillary packages like Mason and Nagios.

of web application development. Author Steve Suehring emphasizes the
security implications of Perl, drawing on years of experience teaching
