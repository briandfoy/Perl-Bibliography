Historically, programming hasn't been considered a critical skill for
biologists. But now, with access to vast amounts of biological data
contained in public databases, programming skills are increasingly in
strong demand in biology research and development. Perl, with its
highly developed capacities in string handling, text processing,
networking, and rapid prototyping, has emerged as the programming
language of choice for biological data analysis.

Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics covers the core Perl language and
many of its module extensions, presenting them in the context of
biological data and problems of pressing interest to the biological
community. This book, along with Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics,
forms a basic course in Perl programming. This second volume finishes
the basic Perl tutorial material (references, complex data structures,
object-oriented programming, use of modules--all presented in a
biological context) and presents some advanced topics of considerable
interest in bioinformatics.

The range of topics covered in Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics
prepares the reader for enduring and emerging developments in critical
areas of bioinformatics programming such as:

Gene finding
String alignment
Methods of data storage and retrieval (SML and databases)
Modeling of networks (graphs and Petri nets)
Graphics (Tk)
Parallelization
Interfacing with other programming languages
Statistics (PDL)
Protein structure determination
Biological models of computation (DNA Computers)

Biologists and computer scientists who have conquered the basics of
Perl and are ready to move even further in their mastery of this
versatile language will appreciate the author's well-balanced approach
to applying Perl's analytical abilities to the field of
bioinformatics. Full of practical examples and real-world biological
problem solving, this book is a must for any reader wanting to move
beyond beginner level Perl in bioinformatics.
