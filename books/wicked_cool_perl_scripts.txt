Most Perl programmers have been frustrated at one time or another
because the system just wouldn't do what they wanted it to do. There
was that one simple and obvious utility that was missing that would
make life so much easier: A tool to get a stock quote, show off a
photograph collection, or even display a collection of favorite
comics. Wicked Cool Perl Scripts is about writing those utilities
quickly and easily. A collection of handy utilities that solves
difficult problems, Wicked Cool Perl Scripts is a great resource for
the savvy Perl programmer.
