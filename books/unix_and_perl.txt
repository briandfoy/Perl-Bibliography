Your research has generated gigabytes of data and now you need to
analyse it. You hate using spreadsheets but it is all you know, so
what else can you do? This book will transform how you work with large
and complex data sets, teaching you powerful programming tools for
slicing and dicing data to suit your needs. Written in a fun and
accessible style, this step-by-step guide will inspire and inform
non-programmers about the essential aspects of Unix and Perl. It shows
how, with just a little programming knowledge, you can write programs
that could save you hours, or even days. No prior experience is
required and new concepts are introduced using numerous code examples
that you can try out for yourself. Going beyond the basics, the
authors touch upon many broader topics that will help those new to
programming, including debugging and how to write in a good
programming style.
