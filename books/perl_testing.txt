Is there any sexier topic in software development than software
testing? That is, besides game programming, 3D graphics, audio,
high-performance clustering, cool websites, et cetera? Okay, so
software testing is low on the list. And that's unfortunate, because
good software testing can increase your productivity, improve your
designs, raise your quality, ease your maintenance burdens, and help
to satisfy your customers, coworkers, and managers.

Perl has a strong history of automated tests. A very early release of
Perl 1.0 included a comprehensive test suite, and it's only improved
from there. Learning how Perl's test tools work and how to put them
together to solve all sorts of previously intractable problems can
make you a better programmer in general. Besides, it's easy to use the
Perl tools described to handle all sorts of testing problems that you
may encounter, even in other languages.

Like all titles in O'Reilly's Developer's Notebook series, this "all
lab, no lecture" book skips the boring prose and focuses instead on a
series of exercises that speak to you instead of at you.

Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook will help you dive right in and:

Write basic Perl tests with ease and interpret the results
Apply special techniques and modules to improve your tests
Bundle test suites along with projects
Test databases and their data
Test websites and web projects
Use the "Test Anything Protocol" which tests projects written in languages other than Perl

With today's increased workloads and short development cycles, unit
tests are more vital to building robust, high-quality software than
ever before. Once mastered, these lessons will help you ensure
low-level code correctness, reduce software development cycle time,
and ease maintenance burdens.

You don't have to be a die-hard free and open source software
developer who lives, breathes, and dreams Perl to use this book. You
just have to want to do your job a little bit better.
