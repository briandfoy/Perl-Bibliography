Combining the best features of C, UNIX utilities, and regular
expressions, Perl has grown as one of the most powerful and popular
scripting languages. The valuable Perl is often used for system
administration, text processing and Web programming. It is even being
used for more exotic areas, like bioinformatics. Perl is supported by
all of the most prominent operating systems, including Windows, Unix,
OS/2, Amiga, and others.

Pro Perl Debugging steps in to help resolve the dilemma of application
testing and debuggingâ€”one of the biggest time commitments in a
programmers daily routine. What this book will do is rescue you from
substandard application testing practices. The book commences with
several chapters that overview the debuggers basic features, then
covers common debugging scenarios. The concluding portion examines
debugger customization, alternative debugging utilities, and debugging
best practices.
