  <!-- Reference new files using XIncludes (not entities): http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/ModularDoc.html#UsingXinclude -->
  <!-- Each file should have a DOCTYPE at the top of it so you can validate it alone (just like this but with a chapter/preface instead of book-->
  <!-- Remember, using XIncludes means that you'll have to add a flag (typically 'xinclude' with one or two dashes) when using XML processors/parsers -->
  <!-- Validate with xmllint as follows (Basic setup same as libxslt: http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/InstallingAProcessor.html)-->
  <!-- (please collapse dashes in the line beloew) -->
  <!-- $ xmllint - -xinclude - -noout - -postvalid book.xml -->
