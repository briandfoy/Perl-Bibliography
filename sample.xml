<simpara>This book will help you master the data analysis and modeling techniques in Excel 2010 that help you transform data into bottom-line results. These materials have been tested while teaching thousands of analysts working for Fortune 500 corporations and government agencies, including the U.S. Army.

You will also learn about some recent developments in business thinking, such as real options, customer value, and mathematical pricing models. You will even learn how to predict U.S. presidential elections, how to set football point spreads, how to determine the probability of winning at craps, and how to determine the probability of a specific team winning an NCAA tournament. These examples are interesting and fun, and they teach you a lot about solving business problems with Excel.</simpara>
